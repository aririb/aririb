## Hello!

I am a student at the University of Massachusetts Lowell studying computer science. I will be graduating in May of 2025.

I am currently working on learning product management skills, both at work and at home!
I have a year of full-time internship product management experience through two co-ops.
I hope to become a full-time product manager after graduation!

In my degree, I have focused on graphical user interfaces and my capstone project, texturetalk, reflects this. I enjoy
creating and improving interfaces revolving around the user.
